## Project 2: Data Cleaning
**Description:**  
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing movie-related data, as indicated by the files `HW2-Movies.csv` and `HW2-Movies.json`. The report documents the data cleaning process and findings.

**What was created:**  
- Data files:  
  - [HW2-Movies.csv](Project_2/HW2-Movies.csv)  
  - [HW2-Movies.json](Project_2/HW2-Movies.json)  
- Report:  
  - [HW2-report.md](Project_2/HW2-report.md)  

**Examples of work:**  
- The `.csv` and `.json` files ([HW2-Movies.csv](Project_2/HW2-Movies.csv), [HW2-Movies.json](Project_2/HW2-Movies.json)) contain structured data about movies, such as titles, genres, ratings, or box office performance.  
- The report ([HW2-report.md](Project_2/HW2-report.md)) includes insights into the data cleaning process.

## Project 3: Creating Visualizations with Python and Tableau
**Description:**  
This project involves creating various types of visualizations, such as scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts, using datasets like `auto-mpg.csv`, `drivers.csv`, and `IBM.csv`. It also discusses the Idiom/Mark/Data/Encode Table for each chart.

**What was created:**  
- Visualizations:  
  - [auto_mpg_scatter_plot.png](Project_3/auto_mpg_scatter_plot.png)  
  - [bar_chart.png](Project_3/bar_chart.png)  
  - [ibm_stock_line_chart.png](Project_3/ibm_stock_line_chart.png)  
- Data files:  
  - [auto-mpg.csv](Project_3/auto-mpg.csv)  
  - [drivers.csv](Project_3/drivers.csv)  
  - [IBM.csv](Project_3/IBM.csv)  
- Python scripts:  
  - [chartLine.py](Project_3/chartLine.py)  
  - [chartScatter.py](Project_3/chartScatter.py)  
- Report:  
  - [HW3-report.md](Project_3/HW3-report.md)  
- Tableau workbook:  
  - [Tableau_Workbook.twbx](Project_3/Tableau_Workbook.twbx)  

**Examples of work:**  
- [auto_mpg_scatter_plot.png](Project_3/auto_mpg_scatter_plot.png): A scatter plot visualizing relationships in the `auto-mpg.csv` dataset.  
- [ibm_stock_line_chart.png](Project_3/ibm_stock_line_chart.png): A line chart showing trends in IBM stock prices from the `IBM.csv` dataset.  
- [bar_chart.png](Project_3/bar_chart.png): A bar chart created from the `drivers.csv` dataset.  
- The report discusses the Idiom/Mark/Data/Encode Table for each chart.

## Project 4: Creating Charts and Discussing Idiom/Mark/Data/Encode Table
**Description:**  
This project involves creating two charts and discussing the Idiom/Mark/Data/Encode Table for each chart.

**What was created:**  
- Visualizations:  
  - [chart1.png](Project_4/chart1.png)  
  - [chart2.png](Project_4/chart2.png)  

**Examples of work:**
